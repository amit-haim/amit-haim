I am a JSD candidate at <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/">Stanford Law School</a> in California. 
My research interests are the intersection of administrative law and decision-making and artificial intelligence, primarily via an empirical legal studies perspective.

<br>
<br>
Previously I was a visiting scholar at the <a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/ili">Information Law Institute</a> at New York University.
